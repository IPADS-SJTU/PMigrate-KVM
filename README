Parallel migration support for KVM
branch v-two is the first stable version of PMigrate-KVM
branch compress-new is the stable version of PMigrate-KVM with compression optimization support

HOWTO use:
To start a live migration migration, we need to setup a migration config file:

SSL_type=0
h_ip=10.131.201.44:4444,10.131.201.46:5555,10.131.201.47:5777,10.131.201.48:5888
d_ip=10.131.201.54:4444,10.131.201.56:5555,10.131.201.57:4777,10.131.201.58:4888
ip_num=4
slave_num=4
max_iter=30
max_factor=4
max_downtime=200000000
throughput=120
compression=0

The SSL_Type is set to NULL (only support NULL now)
The SECOND line shows the host ip:port pairs in sending the data
The THIRD line shows the destination ip:port pairs in receving migration data
The FORTH line shows how many connection used in data transferring
The FIFTH line shows how many consumer threads (slave threads) are used for data processing
The SIX line shows the max number of iterations used in the migration (after 29 pre-copy iterations, the last iteration is forced to happen)
The SEVENTH line shows the maximum number of memory data to be sent in the migration
The EIGHTH line shows the maximum_domtime the migration can endure when the estimiated downtime is below max_downtime, the migration process will enter the last iteration
The NINTH line shows the max network I/O throughput of each connection
The TENTH line shows whether to compress data in migration (default is 0, for branch of compress-new, you can set it io 1)

The migration command in the QEMU Console is similar to the vanilla one, and there is no need to set migrate_max_speed and migrate_max_downtime as will be loaded from the config file.
